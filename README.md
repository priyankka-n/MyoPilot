🏆 CornHacks 2025 | A Corn Odyssey | AI-Driven EMG Control
"In the vastness of space, control is redefined—not by hands, but by thought."

MyoPilot is an embedded AI system that enables hands-free robotic control using electromyography (EMG). Designed for precision, efficiency, and adaptability in extreme environments, MyoPilot translates facial muscle movements into real-time navigation commands—a breakthrough in biomechanical control and embedded intelligence.

This project is a step toward the future of astronaut interfaces, assistive robotics, and next-generation control systems.

🛰 Project Mission: Seamless Neural-Driven Navigation
MyoPilot integrates EMG signal processing, AI-based classification, and embedded motor control into a fully self-contained system. Unlike traditional robotic interfaces, MyoPilot requires no handheld controllers, no external computation, and no latency-inducing middleware.

🔹 Right Cheek Clench → Turn Right
🔹 Left Cheek Clench → Turn Left
🔹 Both Cheeks Clench → Move Forward
🔹 No Movement → Remain Stationary

This system enables precise, intuitive, and effort-minimal control—ideal for zero-gravity environments, high-stakes operations, and accessibility applications.

🔬 System Overview: A Closed-Loop Neural Control System
MyoPilot is a modular, AI-enhanced biomechanical interface, engineered for real-time responsiveness and power efficiency.

Component	Role
ESP32-A (Neural Signal Processing & AI)	Captures EMG signals, filters noise, extracts key features, classifies intent using an AI model, and transmits movement commands.
ESP32-B (Motor Control & Navigation)	Receives movement commands via WiFi, executes real-time motor control, and maneuvers the rover accordingly.
🚀 Signal Flow: From Neural Impulse to Motion
1️⃣ EMG Signal Acquisition (ESP32-A)

Surface electrodes detect biopotential changes from facial muscle contractions
Signals undergo analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)
Bandpass filtering (20-450Hz) & feature extraction (MAV, RMS, ZCR)
2️⃣ AI-Based Classification (ESP32-A)

TinyML model (TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers) processes extracted features
Classifies movement as Left / Right / Forward / No Movement
Transmits movement command to ESP32-B via WiFi (TCP/UDP)
3️⃣ Rover Control Execution (ESP32-B)

Receives classified command from ESP32-A
Drives motor controller to execute precise motion
Ensures real-time responsiveness with sub-100ms latency
📡 Inter-Device Communication Architecture
✅ ESP32-A → ESP32-B over WiFi (TCP/UDP)
✅ ESP32-A (Server): AI classification & command transmission
✅ ESP32-B (Client): Navigation execution & motor control

This low-latency, embedded AI-driven communication ensures high-speed command execution and seamless neural navigation.

🌌 Why MyoPilot Matters: A Step Toward the Future
